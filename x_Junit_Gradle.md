# x_JUnit_Gradle
Java project created using VSCode experimenting with IDE, Gradle, Java, and Junit integration.

**Motivation**: Test the VSCode IDE with Gradle/Java/Junit projects.  
**Solution**: VSCode IDE works great with Java using Redhat Java Extensions and VSCode Debugger extensions.

-created this project (copy of x_Junit_Maven) to experiment with VSCode, Java, Gradle, and JUnit.  
-added basic Gradle build.gradle
```
    /*
    * This file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.
    *
    * This is a general purpose Gradle build.
    * Learn how to create Gradle builds at https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/
    */

    apply plugin: 'java'

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
            testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
    }
```
-the critical section of **build.gradle** is the **repositories** element configuration which must contain mavenCentral() for dependency resolution.
